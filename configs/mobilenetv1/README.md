## Introduction

***
Compared with the traditional convolutional neural network, MobileNetV1's parameters and the amount of computation are
greatly reduced on the premise that the accuracy rate is slightly reduced.
(Compared to VGG16, the accuracy rate is reduced by 0.9%, but the model parameters are only 1/32 of VGG). The model is
based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build lightweight deep neural
networks.
At the same time, two simple global hyperparameters are introduced, which can effectively trade off latency and
accuracy.
