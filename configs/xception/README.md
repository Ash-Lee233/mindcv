## Introduction

***
Xception is another improved network of InceptionV3 in addition to inceptionV4, using a deep convolutional neural
network architecture involving depthwise separable convolution, which was developed by Google researchers. Google
interprets the Inception module in convolutional neural networks as an intermediate step between regular convolution and
depthwise separable convolution operations. From this point of view, the depthwise separable convolution can be
understood as having the largest number of Inception modules, that is, the extreme idea proposed in the paper, combined
with the idea of residual network, Google proposed a new type of deep convolutional neural network inspired by Inception
Network architecture where the Inception module has been replaced by a depthwise separable convolution module.
