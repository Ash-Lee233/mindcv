## Introduction

***
InceptionV4 studies whether the Inception module combined with Residual Connection can be improved. It is found that the
structure of ResNet can greatly accelerate the training, and the performance is also improved. An Inception-ResNet v2
network is obtained, and a deeper and more optimized Inception v4 model is also designed, which can achieve comparable
performance with Inception-ResNet v2.
