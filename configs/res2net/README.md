## Introduction

***
We propose a novel building block for CNNs, namely Res2Net, by constructing hierarchical residual-like connections
within one single residual block. The Res2Net represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the
range of receptive fields for each network layer. The proposed Res2Net block can be plugged into the state-of-the-art
backbone CNN models, e.g. , ResNet, ResNeXt, BigLittleNet, and DLA. We evaluate the Res2Net block on all these models
and demonstrate consistent performance gains over baseline models.
