## Introduction

***
GoogLeNet is a new deep learning structure proposed by Christian Szegedy in 2014. Prior to this, AlexNet, VGG and other
structures achieved better training effects by increasing the depth (number of layers) of the network, but the increase
in the number of layers It will bring many negative effects, such as overfit, gradient disappearance, gradient
explosion, etc. The proposal of inception improves the training results from another perspective: it can use computing
resources more efficiently, and can extract more features under the same amount of computing, thereby improving the
training results.
