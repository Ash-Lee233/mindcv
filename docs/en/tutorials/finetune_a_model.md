# Finetune a Model on a Custom Dataset

Perform fine-tuning on customized data based on the pre-training model, including model loading, data preparation, finetune, evaluation, and visual analysis (if any), Provide advanced tutorials on the following points:
1) Create custom dataset.
2) Customize data preparation pipeline, for example, custom transform. This part is different from the PyTorch interface and needs to be described more.
